# For the design and analysis of the Sample-Sketch algorithm, please see section 2 in str_sketch.pdf.

str_sketch.pdf introduces three different sketching algorithms that are based on similar ideas, the second of which
is developed in this project.

# The author is currently working on more practically useful implementations of Sample-Sketch.
